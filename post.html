                    <p>Music is the greatest creation of man, which touches the soul and also helps man to sympathetically manifest unspoken desire and humanity in him. The effect of music in man is what that separated him from other animals. Due to the high effect of music in the life of human being, it is capable of breaking boundaries to unit people from different background and cultural heritage. Indeed, there are lots to say about music making it one of the most important factors in the life of human being of all races and religions. In fact, music can best be described as wonderful force that is capable of bonding people together and instituting international brotherhood, love as well as peace. This article is dedicated to pinpoint some importance of music.</p>

                    <p>Listening to instrumental music challenges one to listen and tell a story about what one hears. In the same sense, playing a musical instrument gives you the ability to tell the story without words. Both require maximum right brain usage which not only exercises ones creativity but also ones intellect.</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Music is a Language</h2>

                    <p>You’ve heard this time and time again, but what does it mean exactly? Music is universal in that there are no boundaries to understanding music. Even animals like Birds, Dogs, and Whales can understand music to a certain degree.</p>

                    <p>It transcends all boundaries of communication because you can speak and tell stories to someone on the other side of the planet, even though you both don’t speak the same language. But I believe its important for one to have an open mind in order to be in touch with that sense of understanding.</p>

                    <blockquote>Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything.</blockquote>

                    <p>Many people immediately push away certain styles of music without having explored what it has to offer. Not all styles will appeal or resonate with a person, but one may discover a new part of ones self when you are open to all the possibilities.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Music Feels You</h2>

                    <p>Music can whisk you away on an extended journey. Music can make time feel frozen. Music also has the power to suggest movement. All these things deal with the human senses.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">When you are happy you enjoy the music, But when you are sad you understand the lyrics.</span>

                    <p> Really, no matter the pain in the heart of your spouse, the best solvent you need to melt the pain and replace the space with love and passion is simply gentle and soft music. In fact, music is love, peace, passion, creativity and music is capable of enchanting both the heart of man and God.</p>

                    <p>What is amazing about music is that it is imbedded within all of us. Everyone can understand it and feel something if they open themselves up. Playing music with others is an incredible feeling.There is a certain type of connection that comes when you make music in a group. The same is true for those who are listening to music in a group and interacting with music through Dance. This type of behavior is rooted in our history and our discoveries as human beings.</p>
